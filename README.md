# MaximumStrength 

MaximumStrength is a script used to assess temporal dynamics of receptive fields (RF) and magnitude of the response to sparse noise stimulation. The maximum values (the pixel with largest response) and peak strength (power, all contiguous spatial position in this spatial RF) dynamics are used. Temporal dynamics of the RF maps were generated by using a sliding time window with a chosen step and duration. The dynamics of average spatial responses at each time delay was fit with a polynomial function. From these fits next parameters can be extracted: latency of visual response (defined as the time at which the variance first crosses the three times SD above the mean variance of noise at delay 0â€“15 ms after stimulus onset), peak latency of the response (measured as the time at which the interpolating function reached maximum value), duration of the response (defined as the full width of the interpolating function at half maximum value), and Sign index that indicate the ON or OFF subfield dominance.
