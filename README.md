# MaximumStrength 

MaximumStrength is a script used to assess temporal dynamics of receptive fields (RF) and magnitude of the response to sparse noise stimulation. The maximum values (the pixel with largest response) and peak strength (power, all contiguous spatial position in this spatial RF) dynamics are used. Temporal dynamics of the RF maps were generated by using a sliding time window with a chosen step and duration. The dynamics of average spatial responses at each time delay was fit with a polynomial function. From these fits next parameters can be extracted: latency of visual response (defined as the time at which the variance first crosses the three times SD above the mean variance of noise at delay 0â€“15 ms after stimulus onset), peak latency of the response (measured as the time at which the interpolating function reached maximum value), duration of the response (defined as the full width of the interpolating function at half maximum value), and Sign index that indicate the ON or OFF subfield dominance. 

## Installation

We need python-language and a few additional modules (packages) to run our scripts. To get more information about python visit web-sites: https://www.python.org/. Please keepin mind that the newest versions of python won't work with old operating systems as Windows 7, Windowx XP etc. So please pay attention what you download and install. Please read documentation to install, delete or update Python-language and packages.

Install latest version of python for all user. Install it for all users. For Windows 7 it will be vesrion 3.8.10 and for Windows 10 or 11 it will be version 3.13.0 or later. To install scikit-learn package we have to install Microsoft Visual Studio. The latest Community-version will be good. We need only desktop application support in Visual Studio. Upgrade pip and install packages. 

Check the "import" statements in all *.py files to know what modules do we have to install. "import" statements are also used for using standard python modules. No need to install them. A error message after running scripts could say what module is missed. 

**Example 1.1. Install packages:**

*pip install --upgrade matplotlib\
pip install --upgrade numpy\
pip install --upgrade pycodestyle\
pip install --upgrade PyQt6\
pip install --upgrade scikit-learn\
pip install --upgrade scipy\
pip install --upgrade tabulate*              

**Example 1.2. Update packages:**

*python -m pip install --upgrade pip\
pip freeze > list.txt\
pip install -r list.txt --upgrade*
